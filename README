INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Read this if you want to compile from source on a unix-like operating system
(Linux, FreeBsd, Mac OS X, Cygwin).

Before you can use Surfer, you have to install surf,
preferably the version shipped with this source, which supports partial rendering.

First compile and install surf, as described in the documentation for surf.

Next, issue these commands in the directory containing the source:

./configure
make
sudo make install

This will fail if you don't have the necessary libraries installed,
Surfer depends on Gtk-- 2.8, the corresponding package will be called something like
gtkmm2.4-dev or gtkmm-2.4-dev.
It may happen, that your version of gtkmm does not need cairo,
the configure script assumes that you need cairo and fails if doesn't find cairo.
In that case, type
g++ -o surfer src/*.cc `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtkmm-2.4`


Compiling with multicore support:

If your compiler supports OpenMP, then you should pass the options enabling OpenMP
to the configure script.

Example:
g++ has support for OpenMP beginning with version 4.2
If you are using g++ (the executable might be called g++-4.2) then issue the following command

CXX="g++-4.2" CXXFLAGS="-fopenmp" ./configure

instead of ./configure as described above.

-----------------
CONFIGURING

After installation, run the program.
You will find a file .surfer in your home directory
(a file surfer in the installation directory if you are using windows)
where you can modify the following options

gallery=   path to gallery files for surf

print=     issue a command here that prints an image. The sign # will be replaced by the image file to be printed.
           for example
           print=convert # print.ps ; lpr print.ps

surf=      the command to invoke surf

upscale=   values greater than 1.0 increase resolution, values smaller than 1.0 increase performance


COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
usage:
surfer [-f] [file]
where
-f     toggles between fullscreen and windowed mode
file   is a surf script containing the surface to be visualized
       if file is -, then Surfer will read standard input
