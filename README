INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Read this if you want to compile from source on a unix-like operating system
(Linux, FreeBsd, Mac OS X, Cygwin).

Before you can use Surfer, you have to install surf[-alggeo].
Next, issue these commands in the directory containing the source:

./configure
make
make install

This will fail if you don't have the necessary libraries installed,
Surfer depends on Gtkmm 2.8, the corresponding package will be called something like
gtkmm2.4-dev or gtkmm-2.4-dev.

If you have problems compiling Surfer, you may try to ignore the makefile
and use the following command:
g++ -o surfer src/*.cc $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtkmm-2.4)
